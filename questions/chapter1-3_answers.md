## Discussion questions

### Chapter 1

1. If we assume that a single locus contains two alleles, one for the red colour and one for the white, the dominant allele would be the one that is also expressed in the heterozygotes. Furthermore, reproduction between two heterozygous individuals is expected to produce a ratio 3:1 of dominant versus recessive colouration. Dominance exists only when the heterozygote's phenotype measure lies closer to one homozygote than the other.

2. Most of the genetic diseases are recessive because as soon as they expressed at the phenotypic level natural selection will purge them away.

3. If someone exercises every day, runs marathons, eats well, and is generally very healthy, the fitness is not passed on and the person's children still have to work just as hard to get that fit and healthy.

_I have changed my mind, writing the answers is taking me too long!_

BEFORE DARWIN ( - 1809)  
Greek philosophers: organisms can transform into another (similar to Darwin) but for Plato and Aristotle living things were fixed by divine design (reinforced by Christianity).  
Lamarck:  
1. Mysterious innate life force non-living matter - simple organisms (recent) - complex organisms (long history)
2. Inheritance of acquired characteristics

DARWIN and WALLACE (1858)  
Organisms descended from a single common ancestor and history of simple organisms = history of more complex ones.
1. Population growth is limited by resource availability which creates competition and differences in survival and reproduction.  
2. Inheritance of phenotypic variation and part of it affects fitness.  
3. Individuals with higher fitness survive and through reproduction they pass on advantageous traits to the next generation (natural selection).  
4. **Gradual** adaptation to the environment over time with the possibility of forming new species.

MENDEL (1865)  
Genetic heredity crossing garden pea (_Pisum sativum_): yellow (dominant) + green (recessive) = yellow and self-pollinated F1 = 3:1.  
Independent segregation of alleles at meiosis (first law) and random combination at fertilisation.  
The second law (alleles of different genes also segregate independently) is not universally true (genes that are phylically linked).

Biometric school (Galton): phenotypic variation using stats.  
Saltation school (Bateson and de Vries): discrete phenotypes and mutation theory of evolution (**instantaneous** novel forms/species of evening primrose due to mutations but in reality these were genome duplications).

THEORETICAL POP GEN  
Fisher:  
1. Quantitative genetics (1918): continuous traits are inherited via Mendelian law because there is genetic variation in genes that contribute to the phenotype.  
2. Population genetics (1930): selection removes mutations with large phenotypic effects but not small because there is 50% probability that the phenotypic value gets closer to optimum (**gradual** steps).  
3. Null hypothesis.

Wright:  
1. Inbreeding coefficient F<sub>IS</sub>.  
2. Adaptive landscapes (1931): population climbs up to the nearest (and local) fitness maximum by natural selection.  
3. Genetic drift: population can drift from the optimum and cross a low-fitness valley.

Haldane (1932):  
1. Kin selection  
2. Genetics of speciation

MODERN SYNTHESIS  
1. Gradual evolution
2. There is genetic variation within populations (mutations, recombination and gene flow) and allele frequencies change via selection and drift.  
3. Natural selection as a filter of phenotypes with high fitness.  
4. Macro = micro

MOLECULAR GENETICS  
Sutton (1902) and Boveri (1904): chromosomes are pairs, separate at meiosis and all are required for proper embryonic development.  
Morgan (1911): sex-limited inheritance and frequency of crossing over - physical distance between genes (gene mapping).  
Avery (1944): role of DNA in heredity (DNAase vs. protease).  
Watson and Crick (1953).  
1. Four nucleotides composed of a sugar (deoxyribose) bound to a phosphate group and a nitrogen-containing base (A, T, G or C).  
2. Double-stranded helix where sugar and phosphate constitute the backbone. Bases point inwards and are complementary connected by hydrogen bonds.  
3. Anti-parallel 5'-3'.  
4. Proteins can bond to outer edges of each base.

CENTRAL DOGMA OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY  
1. DNA replication: polymerase, deoxy nucleotides, enzymatic repair mechanisms.  
2. Transcription: RNA is single stand, sugar ribose, uracil. Protein synthesis is one process where RNA molecules are involved (mRNA, rRNA, tRNA).
3. Translation: codons-anticodons.

NEUTRAL THEORY (evolution at the molecular level)  
Kimura (1968) alternative theory to modern synthesis (based on Darwinian natural selection: directional selection changes allele frequency and balancing selection such as heterozygote advantage maintain genetic polymorphisms).  
1. Evolutionary changes mostly by random genetic drift.  
2. Most variation is selectively neutral and not maintained by balancing selection.  
3. Most mutations are deleterious and thus transient.  

### Chapter 2

### Chapter 3

1. The Hardy-Weinberg model hardly applies to any natural population. Why is it nevertheless useful?

2. In a small population, genetic drift will lead to a reduction in the frequency of heterozygotes relative the Hardy-Weinberg expectation - is this true or false? Discuss why.

3. Why is it that when an allele goes to fixation in a population, there are no heterozygotes but there is also no deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg expectation?
