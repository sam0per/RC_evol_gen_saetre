## Discussion questions

1. The Hardy-Weinberg model hardly applies to any natural population. Why is it nevertheless useful?

2. In a small population, genetic drift will lead to a reduction in the frequency of heterozygotes relative the Hardy-Weinberg expectation - is this true or false? Discuss why.

3. Why is it that when an allele goes to fixation in a population, there are no heterozygotes but there is also no deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg expectation?
