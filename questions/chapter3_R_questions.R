### Discussion questions

#1.	The Hardy-Weinberg model hardly applies to any natural population. 
#   Why is it nevertheless useful?

#2. In a small population, genetic drift will lead to a reduction in the frequency
#   of heterozygotes relative the Hardy-Weinberg expectation - is this true or false?
#   Discuss why.

## 3. Why is it that when an allele goes to fixation in a population, there are no
# heterozygotes but there is also no deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg expectation?

### R coding questions

## 4. Write a simple R function called square that will return the square of any numeric
##    variable it is given.

## 5.	You genotype a species of grasshoppers along a north south transect across the European Alps.
##    Near Munich, Germany, north of the Alps you sample 120 individuals; near Innsbruck, Austria, 
##    within the Alps you sample 122 individuals; near Verona, Italy, south of the Alps you sample 
##   118 individuals. You find the following number of each genotype.
##
##   Munich - 6 (A1A1), 33 (A1A2), 81 (A2A2)
##   Innsbruck  - 20 (A1A1), 59 (A1A2), 43 (A2A2)
##   Verona - 65 (A1A1), 39 (A1A2), 14 (A2A2)
##
##   Using the R code we learnt during the tutorial, calculate the allele frequencies in each population.
##   Then test whether there is a deviation from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium in each of them.

## 6. Using the functions we wrote during the tutorial, simulate drift over 2000 generations for a population
##    of 100 individuals. How does altering p from 0.3, 0.5 and 0.9 alter the outcome of the simulations? Which
##    is more likely to go to fixation?
